# RPG Practice Project
A basic project to explore and develop skills in Python, by creating a simple role playing game.

Though this project uses Final Fantasy I as its base inspiration (due to the game's simplicity and varied possibilities), over time it should evolve into something much more than a basic RPG as my skills advance.
